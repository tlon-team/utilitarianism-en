# utilitarismo-en

Original English files of `utilitarianism.net`.

TODO: update all the BibTeX keys, like we did with `uqbar`. Ideally all the relevant replacements should be performed on the English files, to minimize duplication of effort when translating the same content into multiple languages.

The repository with the original English content can be found
[here](https://github.com/whyboris/utilitarianism.net).
